A complex number _a + bi_ can be handled as a composite of two real numbers
(real part _a_ and imaginary part _b_).

Write a program that is able to read and print real numbers and stores them
into an appropriate datastructure. The output should be formatted as _a + bi_,
but you can ask for the real and imaginary part separately.

Write a function that takes a complex number as an argument and returns its
absolute value.

**Experts:** write functions to add and multiply complex numbers. Also, accept
input in the shape of _a + bi_.


###Hints###

You have to pass a _complex number_ as an parameter.

**Experts:** you are fine using _fgets_, then take a look at _sscanf_ of
_strtod_.

A point in 2D consists of two positions: x and y (both _float_).
A circle consists of a centre (_point_), a radius, a circumference and an area
(all _float_).

Write a program that reads two positions and a radius from the command line.
They should be stored in a _struct circle_ as described above along with its
remaining parameters (calculate them!). Then, print the resulting circle.

**Experts:** write a function that takes two _circles_ as arguments and returns
a circle that goes through their centres.

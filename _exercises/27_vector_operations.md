Write a program that takes two vectors as input and prints their sum.

The number of elements in each vector is up to the user.

**Experts:** do the same with two matrices

###Hints###

You need some conventions to allow the user to tell you when the input of a vector is finished.

Think of possible input errors, e.g. one vector having more elements.

**Experts:** A 2D dynamic array is a dynamic array of pointers. Each of those pointers has its own dynamic array allocated to it.

**Experts:** You need a lot more conventions!

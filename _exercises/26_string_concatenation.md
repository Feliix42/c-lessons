*strncat()* concatenates two strings. Have a closer look at it:
    $ man 3 strncat

Write a program that reads a series of strings from the user input and concatenates them.

Each string is put at the front so that the result is in reversed order.

*Experts:* At the end, let the user enter one last string. Check, if that one occures in the string you have put together.

###Hints###

End the input phase when a '\n' is read (empty line).

Always check if your buffer is large enough and resize it, if needed.

**Experts:** *strstr()* may be an option.
